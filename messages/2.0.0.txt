This plugin was taken over to improve the functionality.

Main differences:

- Instead of trying to prevent the menu from showing on startup, the user can use the "View > Hide Menu" option.
- This plugin will prevent the menu from being shown on new windows, essentially hiding the menu forever.

Because of the take-over and the changes, this version is flagged as version 2.0.0.
